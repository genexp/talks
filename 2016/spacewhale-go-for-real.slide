* Environment

- Use `Make`
- Follow 12-factor
- Don't regurgitate internet memes
- Use `.env`
- Not in the way that you think
- Go with the grain
- Go is meant to be compiled to a binary.
- You no longer distribute project directories
- Things like migrations, fixtures etc. should all be compiled in.
- There are a lot of good baked in libraries
- The way you structure your workspace is weird, but in nice way
- Goroutines are awesome, but don't overuse them
- Architectural differences of a language where you can parallelize work (vs. multiple processes)
- Dependency management is rough, godeps, glide, etc.
- Testing is awesome
- Benchmarking is awesome
- Code linting is awesome
- Cyclic dependencies are awesome
- Coverage is awesome
- go fmt is awesome
- Metrics are awesome
- expvar is awesome
- Tooling space isn't what you're used to
- Grew up alongside docker, so very good for targeted services
- Some language features are really nice, Capital vs. lowercase functions
- Interfaces are the shit
- Lack of polymorphism is awesome,  uses interfaces instead
- Lack of inheritence is awesome, uses composition instead
- Every folder is a package, that's weird
- Lightweight dev environment needed to be very productive, or IDE
- Compiles to damn near everything
- Works great in docker
- Each to deploy at scale
- Heroku cmd folder pattern is nice
- doc.go in the root of any library
- Documentation practically writes itself
